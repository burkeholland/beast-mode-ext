# Beast Mode Extension Refactoring - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements for refactoring the `extension.ts` file in the Beast Mode VS Code extension to improve code maintainability, readability, and structure while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Goals

- **Improve code readability** - Make the code easier to understand for new developers
- **Enhance maintainability** - Organize code into logical, reusable modules  
- **Follow best practices** - Apply TypeScript/VS Code extension development best practices
- **Remove redundancy** - Eliminate duplicate code and simplify complex logic
- **Maintain functionality** - Preserve all existing features without breaking changes

## User Stories & Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| FR001 | Code Organization | As a developer, I want the extension code to be organized into logical modules so I can easily navigate and understand the codebase | - Main extension class is broken into smaller, focused classes<br>- Related functionality is grouped together<br>- Each file has a single responsibility |
| FR002 | Configuration Management | As a developer, I want configuration loading and management to be handled by a dedicated service so it's easier to maintain and test | - Remote config fetching is separated into its own class<br>- Configuration parsing is isolated<br>- Error handling is consistent across config operations |
| FR003 | HTTP Communication | As a developer, I want HTTP requests to be handled by a reusable utility so network operations are consistent and testable | - HTTP requests are abstracted into a utility class<br>- Timeout and error handling is standardized<br>- Gist and regular URL fetching share common logic |
| FR004 | Schema Processing | As a developer, I want schema inference and processing to be modular so it can be easily extended and tested | - Schema processing is in a dedicated class<br>- Type inference logic is clearly separated<br>- Extension schema lookup is abstracted |
| FR005 | State Management | As a developer, I want state management to be clearly defined so the data flow is easy to follow | - State building logic is separated from UI logic<br>- State updates follow a consistent pattern<br>- Global state operations are centralized |
| FR006 | Error Handling | As a developer, I want consistent error handling throughout the extension so debugging is easier | - All async operations have proper error handling<br>- Errors are logged consistently<br>- Fallback behavior is predictable |
| FR007 | Type Safety | As a developer, I want strong typing throughout the codebase so type errors are caught at compile time | - All interfaces are well-defined<br>- Function parameters and return types are explicit<br>- Type guards are used where appropriate |
| FR008 | Code Documentation | As a developer, I want clear documentation and comments so the code intent is obvious | - All public methods have JSDoc comments<br>- Complex logic has explanatory comments<br>- Interfaces are well-documented |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| NFR001 | Performance | The refactored code should not negatively impact extension performance | - Extension activation time remains the same or improves<br>- Memory usage does not increase<br>- UI responsiveness is maintained |
| NFR002 | Backwards Compatibility | All existing functionality must continue to work exactly as before | - All existing commands work<br>- Settings webview functions identically<br>- Remote config loading behaves the same |
| NFR003 | Testability | The refactored code should be easier to unit test | - Classes have clear interfaces<br>- Dependencies can be mocked<br>- Logic is separated from VS Code API calls |
| NFR004 | Code Quality | The refactored code should follow TypeScript and VS Code extension best practices | - ESLint passes without warnings<br>- TypeScript compiler has no errors<br>- Code follows consistent formatting |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Extension.ts file is under 500 lines (currently ~750 lines)
- [ ] Code is organized into at least 4 separate modules/classes
- [ ] All existing functionality works without regression
- [ ] ESLint and TypeScript compilation pass without errors
- [ ] Code coverage for new modules is >80% when tests are added
- [ ] New developer onboarding time is reduced by clear code organization

## Out of Scope

- Adding new features or functionality
- Changing the public API or user-facing behavior
- Modifying the webview HTML or styling
- Changing the extension manifest (package.json contributions)
- Performance optimizations beyond code organization

## Dependencies

- VS Code Extension API
- TypeScript compiler
- ESLint configuration
- Existing test framework

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Breaking existing functionality | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing after each refactoring step |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Performance testing during development |
| Over-engineering | Medium | Medium | Keep refactoring focused on readability and maintainability |
| Inconsistent patterns | Low | Medium | Define clear coding standards before starting |
