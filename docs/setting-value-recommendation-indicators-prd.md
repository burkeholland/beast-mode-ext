# Product Requirements Document: Setting Value Recommendation Indicators

## Overview

This PRD defines a feature to visually indicate when user settings values differ from recommended values in the Beast Mode VS Code extension settings interface. The goal is to help users identify when their current configuration deviates from suggested optimal values.

## Background

The Beast Mode extension manages VS Code configuration settings through a custom webview interface. Currently, users can see and modify their settings values, but there's no visual indication when their current values differ from recommended best practices. This makes it difficult for users to understand if their configuration is optimal.

## Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Provide visual feedback when user settings values differ from recommended values
- **Secondary Goal**: Maintain existing UI aesthetics while adding clear, non-intrusive visual indicators
- **Success Metric**: Users can easily identify settings that deviate from recommendations

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| FR001 | Visual Recommendation Indicator | As a user, I want to see a visual indicator when my setting value differs from the recommended value so I can identify non-optimal configurations. | When a setting's current value differs from the recommended value, a yellow dot or indicator should appear next to the control, making it immediately visible that this setting deviates from recommendations. |
| FR002 | Tooltip Information | As a user, I want to see what the recommended value is when I hover over the indicator so I can understand what the optimal setting should be. | Hovering over the recommendation indicator should show a tooltip displaying "Recommended: [value]" along with any additional context about why this value is recommended. |
| FR003 | Consistent Visual Design | As a user, I want the recommendation indicators to match the existing UI theme and design so the interface remains cohesive. | The indicator should use VS Code's theme colors and follow the existing design patterns in the webview, appearing as a subtle but noticeable visual cue. |
| FR004 | Support for All Setting Types | As a user, I want recommendation indicators to work for all setting types (boolean, number, string, dropdown) so I get consistent feedback across all configurations. | The indicator system should work for toggles, number inputs, text inputs, and dropdown selects, adapting to each control type appropriately. |
| FR005 | Configuration-Driven Recommendations | As an extension maintainer, I want to be able to specify recommended values in the configuration JSON so recommendations can be updated without code changes. | The remote/local config.json should support a `recommended` field for each setting that defines the optimal value for that setting. |
| FR006 | No Indicator for Matching Values | As a user, I want to only see indicators when values differ from recommendations so the interface isn't cluttered with unnecessary visual elements. | When a setting's current value matches the recommended value, no indicator should be displayed, keeping the interface clean. |
| FR007 | Graceful Degradation | As a user, I want the interface to work normally even when recommendation data is missing so the feature doesn't break existing functionality. | If a setting doesn't have a recommended value defined, no indicator should appear and the setting should function exactly as before. |

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Recommendation checking should not noticeably impact webview rendering performance
- Indicators should appear immediately when the webview loads

### Accessibility
- Indicators should be accessible to screen readers with appropriate ARIA labels
- Visual indicators should not rely solely on color (use shape/icon + color)
- Tooltip content should be accessible via keyboard navigation

### Maintainability
- Recommendation values should be configurable via the existing config.json structure
- The implementation should integrate cleanly with the existing codebase architecture
- Changes should follow the established TypeScript patterns and interfaces

## Success Criteria

1. **Visual Clarity**: Users can immediately identify settings that deviate from recommendations
2. **Information Availability**: Users can easily discover what the recommended value should be
3. **Design Consistency**: The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing UI
4. **Configuration Flexibility**: Recommendations can be easily updated through configuration files
5. **Zero Regression**: Existing functionality continues to work exactly as before

## Out of Scope

- Automatic application of recommended values (users must manually change settings)
- Complex recommendation logic based on other settings or environment
- Historical tracking of recommendation changes
- Bulk operations to apply all recommendations at once

## Dependencies

- Existing webview infrastructure
- Current configuration loading system
- VS Code theming system
- Tooltip implementation in the webview

## Timeline

This feature should be implementable within the existing extension architecture without requiring major refactoring of the core systems.
