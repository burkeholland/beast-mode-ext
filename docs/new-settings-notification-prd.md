# Product Requirements Document: New Settings Notification System

## Overview
The On By Default VS Code extension currently loads settings from remote configurations and displays them in a webview. However, users are not explicitly notified when new settings are added to the remote configuration that they haven't interacted with yet. This feature will implement a notification system to alert users about newly discovered settings, enabling them to make informed decisions about enabling or configuring these new options.

## Problem Statement
Currently, when new settings are added to the remote configuration:
- Users have no indication that new settings are available
- New settings blend in with existing settings without any visual distinction
- Users may miss important new configuration options that could improve their experience
- There's no way to track which settings the user has already seen or configured

## Goals and Objectives
1. **User Awareness**: Notify users when new settings become available in the remote configuration
2. **Visual Distinction**: Clearly mark new/unseen settings in the UI to draw attention
3. **User Choice**: Allow users to acknowledge or dismiss new setting notifications
4. **Persistence**: Track which settings have been seen by the user across sessions
5. **Non-intrusive**: Ensure notifications enhance rather than disrupt the user experience

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| FR001 | New Setting Detection | As a user, I want to be notified when new settings are added to the remote configuration so I can stay up-to-date with new features. | The system should detect when settings appear in the remote config that weren't there before and mark them as "new". |
| FR002 | Visual New Setting Indicators | As a user, I want new settings to be visually distinct so I can easily identify what's changed since my last visit. | New settings should have a visual indicator (badge, highlight, or icon) that distinguishes them from existing settings. |
| FR003 | Settings Discovery Tracking | As a user, I want the system to remember which settings I've already seen so I don't get repeatedly notified about the same settings. | The system should track which settings have been seen by the user and persist this information across sessions. |
| FR004 | Bulk New Settings Notification | As a user, I want to see a summary count of new settings when multiple new settings are added simultaneously. | When multiple settings are new, display a summary indicator showing the total count of new settings. |
| FR005 | Mark as Seen Action | As a user, I want to be able to mark new settings as "seen" without necessarily configuring them so I can clear the new indicators when I've reviewed them. | Provide a way for users to acknowledge they've seen new settings, either individually or in bulk. |
| FR006 | First-time User Experience | As a new user, I don't want to see all settings marked as "new" on my first visit since this would be overwhelming and not helpful. | On first use or when no previous state exists, treat all settings as "seen" rather than marking them all as new. |
| FR007 | Settings Group Context | As a user, I want to understand which group or category new settings belong to so I can better prioritize which ones to review. | New setting indicators should work within the existing group structure and optionally show group-level summaries. |
| FR008 | Notification Persistence | As a user, I want new setting notifications to persist until I explicitly acknowledge them so I don't lose track of what's new. | New setting indicators should remain visible across sessions until the user marks them as seen. |

## Success Metrics
- Users discover and interact with new settings within 7 days of their introduction
- Reduced user support requests about missing features (settings that exist but weren't discovered)
- High user satisfaction with the notification system (measured through feedback)
- Minimal user complaints about notification noise or intrusiveness

## User Experience Requirements
1. **Visual Design**: New setting indicators should follow VS Code's design system and theme colors
2. **Accessibility**: All new setting indicators must be accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers
3. **Performance**: The new settings detection should not significantly impact extension load time
4. **Reversibility**: Users should be able to clear all new indicators if desired

## Technical Requirements
1. **State Persistence**: Track seen settings in VS Code's global state storage
2. **Remote Config Integration**: Integrate with existing remote configuration polling system
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure the feature works with both remote and local configuration sources
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Function correctly even if state storage fails

## Out of Scope
- Push notifications outside of VS Code
- Email notifications about new settings
- Settings recommendation algorithms beyond the existing recommendation system
- Automatic setting value application for new settings

## Constraints and Limitations
1. Must work within VS Code's webview security model
2. Cannot make external network requests beyond existing remote config polling
3. Must maintain performance standards for the settings webview
4. Should not significantly increase extension size or memory usage

## Implementation Considerations
1. **Data Storage**: Use VS Code's extension global state to track seen settings
2. **UI Integration**: Leverage existing webview infrastructure and styling
3. **State Management**: Integrate with existing StateManager and ConfigurationService
4. **Testing**: Ensure functionality works with both remote and local configurations

## Dependencies
- Existing remote configuration polling system
- VS Code's global state storage API
- Current webview UI and styling system
- StateManager and ConfigurationService infrastructure

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
1. **Risk**: State storage corruption or loss
   - **Mitigation**: Implement graceful fallbacks and error handling
2. **Risk**: Performance impact from frequent state checking
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize state access and limit frequency of checks
3. **Risk**: UI clutter from too many new indicators
   - **Mitigation**: Design clean, minimal indicators and provide bulk actions
4. **Risk**: User confusion about what constitutes a "new" setting
   - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and intuitive UX design
